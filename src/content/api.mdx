<mark>**Note**: The <span class="inline-code">TableEntry\<T\></span> type represents your table type with the added <span class="inline-code">\_pk</span> property. So, if your table type is <span class="inline-code">\{ customer: string \}</span>, then the corresponding <span class="inline-code">TableEntry\<T\></span> type is <span class="inline-code">\{ _pk: number, customer: string\}</span></mark>

<br />
<br />

<mark>**Note**: The <span class="inline-code">Partial\<T\></span> type represents your table type with all properties set to optional. This allows you pass the properties most relevant for your query.</mark>

<br />
<br />

<mark>**Note**: methods starting with <span class="inline-code">use</span> will cause your component to rerender. No other method will cause your component to rerender.</mark>

<br />
<br />

<mark>**Note**: PK means _primary key_, which is the <span class="inline-code">\_pk</span> property automatically set for each record in your table.</mark>

## TABLES <span id="tables" />

<span class="inline-code">use(where?: ((v: TableEntry\<T\>) => boolean) | null | , notify?: TableNotify[]): TableEntry\<T\>[]</span>

<hr />

Will rerender your component. If notify is ommitted, the component will rerender for all events. Supported events are: <span class="inline-code">'rowInsert' | 'rowUpdate' | 'rowDelete'</span>. If a filtering function is not provided, this will return all rows in the table.

<span class="inline-code">useRow(pk: PK, notify?: RowNotify[]): TableEntry\<T\> | undefined</span>

<hr />

Will rerender your component. If notify is ommitted, the component will rerender for all events. Supported events are: <span class="inline-code">'rowDelete' | 'rowUpdate'</span>. User supplies the primary key (_pk) for the row they want to use.

<span class="inline-code">insertRow(r: T): TableEntry\<T\> | undefined</span>

<hr />

Insert row into the table. The user does not need to provide the _\_pk_ property as this will be handled automatically. This will return the newly inserted row or _undefined_ if the user has a <span class="inline-code">beforeInsertTrigger</span> attached to the table that aborts the insert.

<span class="inline-code">insertRows(r: T[], batchNotify?: boolean): TableEntry\<T\>[]</span>

<hr />

Insert multiple rows into the table. The user does not need to provide the _\_pk_ property for each row as this will be handled automatically. This will return the newly inserted rows. Any attached triggers (e.g., <span class="inline-code">beforeInsertTrigger</span>) will be fired for each row. By default, components with a matching <span class="inline-code">use()</span> hook will only be rerendered after all rows are inserted (batch). To override this behaviour, pass <span class="inline-code">false</span> as the second argument, instructing trigger to rerenders components on each insert, which is the same behaviour as manually calling <span class="inline-code">insertRow()</span> multiple times.

<span class="inline-code">onBeforeInsert(fn: (v: TableEntry\<T\>) => TableEntry\<T\> | void | boolean) : void</span>

<hr />

A trigger function that can be attached to the table. The function will receive the row being inserted, allowing changes to be made to the value prior to insertion. The user can cancel the insert by returning <span class="inline-code">false</span>. Returning nothing or <span class="inline-code">true</span> will ignore any changes made in the function and insert the row as originally intended.

<span class="inline-code">onAfterInsert(fn: (v: TableEntry\<T\>) => void): void</span>

<hr />

A trigger function that can be attached to the table. The function will receive the newly inserted row.

<span class="inline-code">deleteRow(where: PK | Partial\<T\> | ((v: TableEntry\<T\>) => boolean)) : boolean</span>

<hr />

Will delete the first matching row, returning <span class="inline-code">true</span> if a row was deleted and <span class="inline-code">false</span> if a row was not deleted. The primary use of this function is for when the user knows the primary key (_pk) of the row to be deleted. The user can pass-in the primary key (_pk) of the row to delete, an object to match rows based on equality of each property value, or a function that returns <span class="inline-code">true</span> if the row should be deleted and <span class="inline-code">false</span> if it should not be deleted.

<span class="inline-code">deleteRows(where?: Partial\<T\> | ((v: TableEntry\<T\>) => boolean), batchNotify?: boolean) : number</span>

<hr />

Will return the number of rows that have been deleted, or 0 if no rows were deleted. The user can pass-in an object to match rows based on equality of each property value, or a function that returns <span class="inline-code">true</span> if the row should be deleted and <span class="inline-code">false</span> if it should not be deleted. Any attached triggers (e.g., <span class="inline-code">onDelete</span>) will be fired for each row. By default, components with a matching <span class="inline-code">use()</span> hook will only be rerendered after all rows are deleted (batch). To override this behaviour, pass <span class="inline-code">false</span> as the second argument, instructing trigger to rerender components on each delete, which is the same behaviour as manually calling <span class="inline-code">deleteRow()</span> multiple times. Components with a matching <span class="inline-code">useRow()</span> hook will be rerendered immediately if the row they are subscribed to is deleted.

<span class="inline-code">onBeforeDelete(fn: (v: TableEntry\<T\>) => boolean | void): void</span>

<hr />

A trigger function that can be attached to the table. The function will receive the row being deleted. The user can cancel the deletion by returning <span class="inline-code">false</span>. Returning nothing or <span class="inline-code">true</span> will delete the row.

<span class="inline-code">onAfterDelete(fn: (v: TableEntry\<T\>) => void): void</span>

<hr />

A trigger function that can be attached to the table. The function will receive the deleted row.

<span class="inline-code">updateRow(pk: PK, newValue: Partial\<T\> | ((v: TableEntry\<T\>) => Partial\<T\>)): TableEntry\<T\> | undefined</span>

<hr />

Will return <span class="inline-code">true</span> if the update was successful and <span class="inline-code">false</span> if not. The user passes in the primary key (_pk) to update, and an object with the new property values.

<span class="inline-code">updateRows(setValue: Partial\<T\> | ((v: TableEntry\<T\>) => Partial\<T\>), where?: Partial\<T\> | ((v: TableEntry\<T\>) => boolean), batchNotify?: boolean,): TableEntry\<T\>[]</span>

<hr />

Will return a list of successfully updated rows. The user provides the new values as an object, a function that returns the new values. The user can pass-in an object to match rows based on equality of each property value, or a function that returns <span class="inline-code">true</span> if the row should be updated and <span class="inline-code">false</span> if it should not be updated. Any attached triggers (e.g., <span class="inline-code">onUpdate</span>) will be fired for each row. By default, components with a matching <span class="inline-code">use()</span> hook will only be rerendered after all rows are updated (batch). To override this behaviour, pass <span class="inline-code">false</span> as the third argument, instructing trigger to rerender components on each update, which is the same behaviour as manually calling <span class="inline-code">updateRow()</span> multiple times. Components with a matching <span class="inline-code">useRow()</span> hook will be rerendered immediately if the row they are subscribed to is updated.

<span class="inline-code">onBeforeUpdate(fn: (currentValue: TableEntry\<T\>, newValue: TableEntry\<T\>) => TableEntry\<T\> | void | boolean): void</span>

<hr />

A trigger function that can be attached to the table. The function will receive the row's current value and the new value, allowing changes to be made to the value prior to updating. The user can cancel the update by returning <span class="inline-code">false</span>. Returning nothing or <span class="inline-code">true</span> will ignore any changes made in the function and update the row as originally intended.

<span class="inline-code">onAfterUpdate(fn: (previousValue: TableEntry\<T\>, newValue: TableEntry\<T\>) => void): void</span>

<hr />

A trigger function that can be attached to the table. The function will receive the row's previous value and the row's new value.

<span class="inline-code">getRows(where?: Partial\<T\> | ((v: TableEntry\<T\>) => boolean)): TableEntry\<T\>[]</span>

<hr />

Will return all rows that match. The user can pass-in an object to match rows based on equality of each property value, or a function that returns <span class="inline-code">true</span> if the row should be returned and <span class="inline-code">false</span> if it should not be returned. This function does not cause your component to rerender. Passing in nothing will return all rows.

<span class="inline-code">getRow(where: PK | Partial\<T\> | ((v: TableEntry\<T\>) => boolean)): TableEntry\<T\> | undefined</span>

<hr />

A convenience function for returning the first matching row. The user can pass-in the primary key (_pk) to find, an object to match rows based on equality of each property value, or a function that returns <span class="inline-code">true</span> if the row should be returned and <span class="inline-code">false</span> if it should not be returned. If no row can be found, <span class="inline-code">undefined</span> is returned. 

<span class="inline-code">getRowCount(where?: Partial\<T\> | ((v: TableEntry\<T\>) => boolean)): number</span>

<hr />

Returns the current number of rows in the table. The user can pass-in an object to match rows based on equality of each property value, or a function that returns <span class="inline-code">true</span> if the row should be counted and <span class="inline-code">false</span> if it should not be counted. This function does not cause your component to rerender. Passing in nothing will count all rows in the table

## SINGLES <span id="singles" />

<span class="inline-code">use(): T</span>

<hr />

Will rerender your component. Every time the underlying object changes, the new value will be returned and your component will be rerendered.

<span class="inline-code">set(v: T): T</span>

<hr />

Allows for changing the value. Trigger uses shallow equality comparisons (===) to determine if the underlying value has changed. So, if your underlying value is an object (like an array) you should call <span class="inline-code">set</span> with a new reference to the array (e.g., <span class="inline-code">set([...oldArr, newValue])</span>)

<span class="inline-code">setFn(fn: (currentValue: T) => T): T</span>

<hr />

Allows the user to pass a function that receives the current value. This is the preferred method when setting a value that is dependent on a previous value (e.g., incrementing a counter)

<span class="inline-code">onSet(fn: (v: T) => void): void</span>

<hr />

A trigger function that can be attached to a single each time the value is changed. The function will receive the new value.

<span class="inline-code">onGet(fn: (v: T) => void): void</span>

<hr />

A trigger function that can be attached to a single each time the value is retrieved. The function will receive the value each time <span class="inline-code">get()</span> is called.

<span class="inline-code">get(): T</span>

<hr />

Will retrieve the value, but not cause your component to rerender

## QUEUES <span id="queues" />

<span class="inline-code">insert(item: T, cb?: (ok: boolean) => void): boolean</span>

<hr />

Insert a new item into the queue. Will return <span class="inline-code">true</span> if the insert was successful and <span class="inline-code">false</span> if not

<span class="inline-code">onInsert(fn: (v: T) => void): void</span>

<hr />

A trigger function that can be attached to a queue. The function will receive the inserted value.

<span class="inline-code">get(): QueueItem\<T\> | undefined</span>

<hr />

Will retrieve the item at the head of the queue, or undefined if the queue is currently empty.

<span class="inline-code">onGet(fn: (v: T) => void): void</span>

<hr />

A trigger function that can be attached to a queue. The function will receive the value each time <span class="inline-code">get()</span> is called.

<span class="inline-code">size(): number</span>

<hr />

Will return the number of items in the queue
