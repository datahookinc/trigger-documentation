# Welcome to **Trigger**!

**Trigger** is a <u>data-oriented</u> state management library developed for React and TypeScript. **Trigger** is lightweight, with
0 dependencies, and is designed to optimize the developer experience for working with data in your application.

```bash
npm i @datahook/trigger
```

**Trigger** borrows philosophies and design patterns from database management (e.g., INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE, triggers, transactions, etc.) and spreadsheets; however, it also
borrows design patterns from other popular React state management systems to maximize your productivity.

## Step 1: Create a store in a regular .ts file

<span style={{ fontFamily: 'monospace'}}>store.ts</span>

<div className={codeWrapper}>
    ```typescript
    import { CreateTable, CreateStore } from '@datahook/trigger';

    // declare a table type
    type Person = {
        id: number;
        name: string;
        age: number;
    }

    // create the store
    export const store = CreateStore({
        person: CreateTable<Person>(['id', 'name', 'age']),
    });
    ```
</div>

## Step 2: Use your store in your components

<span style={{ fontFamily: 'monospace'}}>component.tsx</span>

<div className={codeWrapper}>
```tsx
import { store } from './store';

function MyComponent() {
    const rows = store.activeTasks.use();

    return (
        <div>
            There are {rows.length} active tasks in the table
        </div>
    )
}
```
</div>

Trigger uses React hooks internally, which makes it easy to integrate the store into your application. In the above example, we simply need to import the <span class="inline-code">store</span> which
has all of our tables namespaced and ready to use. When using TypeScript, you will also receive type hints about the properties your table contains, if your IDE supports it.

The same table can be used in multiple components, which allows you to control which components need to update when there is a change to the underlying table.
