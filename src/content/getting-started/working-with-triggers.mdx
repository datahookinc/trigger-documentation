# Working with triggers

Triggers are an idiomatic way to perform side effects when interacting with your <span class="inline-code">Tables</span>, <span class="inline-code">Singles</span>, and <span class="inline-code">Queues</span>. This can be quite useful in situations where you need to verify the input, decorate the returned values
with data found in another table/single/queue, or even prevent the action from occurring entirely. This provides a centralized way of managing the data moving into and out of your store, without needing to create separate functions across
your applicaiton.

<mark>**Note:** All triggers in the API are prefixed with <span class="inline-code">on</span> (e.g., <span class="inline-code">onBeforeInsert</span>, <span class="inline-code">onSet</span>, <span class="inline-code">onAfterUpdate</span>, etc.).</mark>

The easiest way to manage your triggers is to declare them when creating your store. For instance, imagine we have created a store with a **customers** table and every time the user attempts to insert a row we interrogate the value
to see if we want to allow it or change it. For this, we would use the table's **onBeforeInsert()** trigger:

<span style={{ fontFamily: 'monospace'}}>store.ts</span>

<div className={codeWrapper}>
```typescript
const s: MyStore = {
    tables: {
        customers: CreateTable<Customer>({ customerID: [], firstName: [], lastName: [] }),
    },
};

s.tables.customers.onBeforeInsert((v) => {
    if (v.firstName === 'OmitMe') {
        return false;
    }

    if (v.lastName === 'ChangeMe') {
        v.lastName = 'Changed';
        return v;
    }
});

```
</div>

<mark>**Note:** You cannot have multiple functions for the same trigger. If a trigger function is redeclared, it will overwrite any existing triggers.</mark>

Now, let's say we want to interrogate the values when a user attempts to update rows in the table. For this, we will use the <span class="inline-code">onBeforeUpdate()</span> trigger:

<div className={codeWrapper}>
```typescript
const s: MyStore = {
    tables: {
        customers: CreateTable<Customer>({ customerID: [], firstName: [], lastName: [] }),
    },
};

s.tables.customers.onBeforeUpdate((cv, nv) => {
    if (cv.firstName === 'UpdateMe') {
        nv.firstName = 'Changed before update';
        return nv;
    }
});
```
</div>

Notice how the <span class="inline-code">onBeforeUpdate()</span> trigger provides us with the current value (<span class="inline-code">cv</span>) and the pending new value (<span class="inline-code">nv</span>). This allows you to review the current value and determine if you want to access the proposed
new values.

A popular use case for triggers is to interact with data in other tables, singles, and queues in your store. Trigger requires your tables to be in a flat structure, which often leads to relationships between tables
to create hiearchies and n-to-n relations. In this setup, you may want to create records in one table when you insert records in another table. In our example above, imagine if every time we create a new **customer** in our
store we also want to create a new **orders** entry. This can be accomplished with the <span class="inline-code">onAfterInsert()</span> trigger along with an <span class="inline-code">insertRow()</span> action on the **orders** table. This use case was the inspiration for triggers so the
user would not need to remember that a relationship exists between these two or more tables - they can declare it idiomatically with triggers when creating their store.


<div className={codeWrapper}>
```typescript
const s: MyStore = {
    tables: {
        customers: CreateTable<Customer>({ customerID: [], firstName: [], lastName: [] }),
        orders: CreateTable<Order>({ orderID: [], customerID: [], orderLocation: [], orderDate: [] }),
    },
};

s.tables.customers.onAfterInsert(v => {
    s.tables.orders.insertRow({ orderID: 100, customerID: v.customerID, orderDate: new Date(), orderLocation: '' });
});
```
</div>

<mark>**Note:** Be cautious! Trigger will not prevent circular triggers (e.g., triggers that cause themselves to fire ad infinitum) - preventing circular triggers is planned for a future release.</mark>
