# Setting up your store

Your store is created by first declaring your types, and then instantiating your store values. Typically, you will keep your store in a separate file for easier reference; however,
this is not strictly required.

Here is an example store:

<span style={{ fontFamily: 'monospace'}}>store.ts</span>

<div className={codeWrapper}>
    ```typescript
    import { extract, CreateTable, type Store, type Table } from '@datahook/trigger';

    // declare a table type
    type Person = {
        id: number;
        name: string;
        age: number;
    }

    // declare the store type
    interface MyStore extends Store {
        tables: {
            person: Table<Person>;
        };
    }

    // create the store
    const s: MyStore = {
        tables: {
            person: CreateTable<Person>({ id: [], name: [], age: []}),
        },
    };

    /*** EXTRACT AND EXPORT OUR STORE */
    export const { tables } = extract(s);
    ```
</div>

In the example above, half of the code is for declaring our table and store types. We first create a type called <span class="inline-code">Person</span> to represent a table in our store. We then declare our store by extending Trigger's default store.

Once we have a our types declared, we can then create our store, along with the initial values for our tables. In this example, the initial table is empty, which is why we pass empty arrays for each of our properties.

Finally, to use your store, we use Trigger's <span class="inline-code">extract</span> function, which pulls the <span class="inline-code">tables</span>, <span class="inline-code">singles</span>, and <span class="inline-code">queues</span> out of the table for exporting. Now, the tables in your store are namespaced and can be referenced as
<span class="inline-code">_tables.person_</span> to provide a great developer experience.


If our table had <span class="inline-code">singles</span> and <span class="inline-code">queues</span>, the store would look like this:
<div className={codeWrapper}>
    ```typescript
    import { extract, CreateSingle, CreateTable, CreateQueue, type Single, type Store, type Table, type Queue } from '@datahook/trigger';

    // declare a table type
    type Person = {
        id: number;
        name: string;
        age: number;
    }

    // declare the store type
    interface MyStore extends Store {
        tables: {
            person: Table<Person>;
        };
        singles: {
            activeTab: Single<number>;
        }
        queues: {
            eventQueue: Queue<string>;
        };
    }

    // create the store
    const s: MyStore = {
        tables: {
            person: CreateTable<Person>({ id: [], name: [], age: []}),
        },
        singles: {
            activeTab: CreateSingle<number>(0),
        },
        queues: {
            eventQueue: CreateQueue<string>(),
        }
    };

    /*** EXTRACT AND EXPORT OUR STORE */
    export const { tables, singles, queues } = extract(s);
    ```
</div>

Notice how when we declare our store we use the <span class="inline-code">Table</span>, <span class="inline-code">Single</span>, and <span class="inline-code">Queue</span> types, and when we create our store we use the <span class="inline-code">CreateTable()</span>, <span class="inline-code">CreateSingle()</span>, and <span class="inline-code">CreateQueue()</span> functions.

You can add as many tables, singles, and queues as you like to your store. It is common for singles to be used for UI type information (e.g., active tab) and for queues to be used for event processing - similar
to how you would use a regular reducer function. This basic structure is how all of your stores will be setup, with most of the complexity coming from declaring your types.
